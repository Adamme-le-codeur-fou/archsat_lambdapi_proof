\section{Introduction}

These days, Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are undeniably quite reliable
tools despite the worst-case exponential run time of all known
algorithms. Modern SAT solvers provide a ``black-box'' procedure that can often
solve hard structured problems with over a million variables and several million
constraints. These tools are therefore used in many applications outside the
scope of knowledge representation and reasoning, which nonetheless was their
initial domain of application. The underlying representational formalism of SAT
solvers is propositional logic, and even if a given problem is not a pure
propositional problem, it is not unusual to encode it so that it can be viewed
as a propositional reasoning task. This encoding may be complex and possibly
costly, but the effectiveness of SAT solvers generally compensates for the cost
of this encoding.
