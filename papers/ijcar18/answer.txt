Concerning correctness of the presented systems.
Assuming, subsystems (1), (2) and (3) respectively corresponds to
the tableaux-like method of finding instanciations, the rewrite
system, and the rigid superposition. Tableaux method correctness implies
correctness of (1). (2) is also correct since it computes normal form
according to a rewrite system and then explicit the equivalence (or equality)
of a term and its normal form. Finally (3) is also correct since it can only
produce inferences that could be inferred in regular superposition (erasing the
set of mappings).

About completeness, (1) relies on the completeness of the tableaux method,
which is guaranteed under fairness of the tableaux expansion strategy.

For rewriting using subsystem (2), we must first assume completeness of the
ground reasonning of the SMT, and completeness of the sequent calculus modulo
the rewriting system used. We then have two cases: either there are no equalities
in the problem, in which case (2) is complete since it computes all normal forms,
after which the proof can be found using ground reasoning. In presence of equalities,
we rely on the completeness of (1) and (3) to find rewrite rules instanciations.
The B theory presented in the paper is a special case where equalities between sets
are syntaxically matched and directly rewritten as predicates on the membership relation,
using the rewrite rule for extensionnality.

(3) TODO

These justifications and clues will be added to the final version of the paper
if accepted though no formal proof will be provided.

Apologies for the inconvenience,
