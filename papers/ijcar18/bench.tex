\subsection{Implementation}

\subsection{Experimental Results}

As a framework for our benchmark, we consider the set theory of the \bmth{}
method~\cite{B-Book}. This method is supported by some tool sets, such as
\atelierb{}, which are used in industry to specify and build, by stepwise
refinements, software that is correct by design. This theory is suitable as it
can be easily turned into a theory that is compatible with deduction modulo
theory, i.e. where a large part of axioms can be turned into rewrite rules, and
for which the rewriting theory proposed previously in Subsec.~\ref{sec:rew}
should work. Starting from the theory described in Chap.~2 of the
\bbook{}~\cite{B-Book}, we therefore transform whenever possible the axioms and
definitions into rewrite rules. The resulting theory has been introduced
in~\cite{BA15}, and due to lack of space, we only provide, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bset}, the three rewriting rules corresponding to the axiomatic
core of the \bmth{} set theory that we consider.

As can be seen, the proposed theory is typed, using first order logic extended
to polymorphic types Ã  la ML, through a type system in the spirit
of~\cite{BP13}. This extension to polymorphic types offers more flexibility, and
in particular allows us to deal with theories that rely on elaborate type
systems, like the \bmth{} set theory (see Chap.~2 of the
\bbook{}~\cite{B-Book}). The complete type system that is used in this
formalization can be found in~\cite{BA15}. The type constructors,
i.e. $\mathsf{tup}$ for tuples and $\mathsf{set}$ for sets, and type schemes of
the considered set constructs are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:bset} as well, where
\type{} is the type of types and $\omicron$ the type of formulas, and where type
arguments are subscript annotations of the constructs.
